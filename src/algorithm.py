def dijkstra(adjlist, start_node):
    '''
    Returns the result of running Dijkstra's algorithm as two N-length lists:
    1) distance d: here, d[i] contains the minimal cost to go from the node
    named `start_node` to the i:th node in the adjacency list.
    2) edges e: here, e[i] contains the node name that the i:th node's shortest
    path originated from.

    If the index i refers to the start node, set the associated values to None.

    Pre: start_node is a member of adjlist.

    === Example ===
    Suppose that we have the following adjacency matrix:

      a b c
    -+-----
    a|* 1 2
    b|* * 2
    c|* * *

    For start node "a", the expected output would then be:

    d: [ None, 1, 2]

def prim(adjlist, start_node):
    '''
    Returns the result of running Prim's algorithm as two N-length lists:
    1) lowcost l: here, l[i] contains the weight of the cheapest edge to connect
    the i:th node to the minimal spanning tree that started at `start_node`.
    2) closest c: here, c[i] contains the node name that the i:th node's
    cheapest edge orignated from. 

    If the index i refers to the start node, set the associated values to None.

    Pre: adjlist is setup as an undirected graph and start_node is a member.

    === Example ===
    Suppose that we have the following adjacency matrix:

      a b c
    -+-----
    a|* 1 3
    b|1 * 1
    c|3 1 *

    For start node "a", the expected output would then be:

    l: [ None, 1, 1]
    c: [ None, 'a', 'b' ]
    '''
    log.info("TODO: prim()")
    l = []
